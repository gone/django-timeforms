## How to use ##
   
   This package contains two classes and some support functions. 
To automatically localize a form have it subclass either the Form or ModelForm class, and pass in the timezone kwarg when creating the form instance.
That will ensure that submitted and rejected forms are localized. To localize a form when first displayed to user, an additional step of calling
form.convert_form_intial_to_local is required.

That's it! Enjoy never having to convert a timezone again.
